However, today both are still often used as delimiters between data. When this weakness exists, CR and LF characters (represented respectively in code as `\\r` and `\\n`) are permitted to be present in HTTP headers, usually due to poor planning for data handling during development.\n\nCRLF sequences in HTTP headers are known as \"response splitting\" because these characters effectively split the response from the browser, causing the single line to be accepted as multiple lines by the server (for example, the single line First Line\\r\\nSecond Line would be accepted by the server as two lines of input).\n\nWhile response splitting in itself is not an attack, and can be completely harmless unless exploited, its presence could lead to an injection attack (known as CRLF injection) and a variety of unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior. This weakness can be exploited in a number of ways, such as page hijacking or cross-user defacement, in which an attacker displays false site content and/or captures confidential information such as credentials. It can even lead to cross-site scripting attacks, in which attackers can cause malicious code to execute in the user's browser.\n\nFor example, the following code is vulnerable:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", request.getParameter(\"name\"));\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nbecause the user may provide a name parameter with a value like `XYZ\\r\\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nATTACKER CONTROLLED`. In this case, they will produce a second HTTP response:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nATTACKER CONTROLLED\n```\n\nA possible fix is to remove all non-alphanumerical characters:\n\n```\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n  String name = request.getParameter(\"name\")\n      .replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\");\n  Cookie cookie = new Cookie(\"name\", name);\n  response.addCookie(cookie);\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the attacker would be unable to produce a second HTTP response.\n\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Assume all input is potentially malicious. Define acceptable responses wherever possible, and if not possible, encode CR and LF characters to prevent header splitting.\n* Replace both `\\r` (carriage return) and `\\n` (line feed) with \"\" (empty string)-many platforms handle these characters interchangeably so the weakness may still exist if one of the two is permitted.\nFollow best practices and strip all other special characters (\", /, \\, ;, etc., as well as spaces) wherever possible.\nBe sure to sanitize special characters in both directions-from the browser to the server and also in data sent back to the browser.\nIdeally, adopt current development resources, such as languages and libraries, that block CR and LF injection in headers.\nBe vigilant with all input types that could potentially be tampered with or modified at the user end (intentionally or unintentionally), which could lead to injection attacks.

The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser's Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they've been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser.|\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user's browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n## Best practices for prevention\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:\n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.","text": ""},"properties": {"tags": ["java","XSS","Security","SourceNonServer","SourceResourceAccess","SourceDatabase","Taint"],"categories":
